# Collectors

Scripts that collect/identify problematic entries from the main JSON file.

## Scripts

### collectMultipleDhatuIds.py
Collects all verbs with multiple dhatu_ids from the generated JSON file.
Creates TWO YAML files - one for verbs without gati, one for verbs with gati.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 Scripts/AI_Generated/scripts/collectors/collectMultipleDhatuIds.py \
    Scripts/output/AkhyataChandrika_Autogenerated.json \
    Scripts/AI_Generated/output
```

**Output:**
- `multiple_dhatu_ids_without_gati.yaml` - Verbs with multiple IDs (no gati)
- `multiple_dhatu_ids_with_gati.yaml` - Verbs with multiple IDs (with gati)

---

### collectNotFoundDhatuIds.py
Collects all verbs where dhatu_id is "Not Found" from the generated JSON file.
Creates TWO YAML files - one for verbs without gati, one for verbs with gati.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 Scripts/AI_Generated/scripts/collectors/collectNotFoundDhatuIds.py \
    Scripts/output/AkhyataChandrika_Autogenerated.json \
    Scripts/AI_Generated/output
```

**Output:**
- `not_found_dhatu_ids_without_gati.yaml` - Verbs with "Not Found" (no gati)
- `not_found_dhatu_ids_with_gati.yaml` - Verbs with "Not Found" (with gati)

---

## Workflow

1. Run collector scripts to identify problematic entries
2. Manually edit the generated YAML files to fix the issues
3. Use backport scripts to apply changes back to original YAML files
