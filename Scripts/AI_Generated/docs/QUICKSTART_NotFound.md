# Not Found Dhatu IDs - Quick Start Guide

## Problem
**576 verbs** have dhatu_id = "Not Found" and need manual assignment.

## Solution - Three Simple Steps

### üì• Step 1: Collect

Run the collection script to find all verbs with "Not Found" dhatu_id:

```bash
cd /Users/adarshtadwai/Documents/GitHub/AkhyataChandrika
python3 Scripts/AI_Generated/scripts/collectNotFoundDhatuIds.py \
    Scripts/output/AkhyataChandrika_Autogenerated.json \
    Scripts/AI_Generated/output
```

**Output**: One YAML file created:
- `Scripts/AI_Generated/output/not_found_dhatu_ids_without_gati.yaml` (576 verbs)

**Note:** Verbs with gati that have "Not Found" dhatu_id are currently 0 entries and not generated.

---

### ‚úèÔ∏è Step 2: Edit Manually

Open `not_found_dhatu_ids_without_gati.yaml` and assign dhatu_ids:

**Before** (Not Found):
```yaml
"‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø":
  "dhatu_id": "Not Found"    # ‚Üê Needs assignment
```

**After** (Corrected):
```yaml
"‡§∏‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø":
  "dhatu_id": "04.0087"       # ‚Üê Assigned correct ID
```

**Tip**: You don't need to edit all 576 at once! Edit 10-20 entries at a time.

---

### üîÑ Step 3: Backport

Apply your corrections to the original YAML files:

```bash
python3 Scripts/AI_Generated/scripts/backportNotFoundDhatuIds.py \
    Scripts/AI_Generated/output \
    Data
```

The script will:
- ‚úÖ Update entries where you assigned dhatu_ids
- ‚è≠Ô∏è Skip entries still marked as "Not Found"
- üìä Report statistics

---

## Incremental Workflow

**Best Practice**: Work in small batches

```bash
# 1. Edit 10-20 verbs in the YAML file
# 2. Run backport
python3 Scripts/AI_Generated/scripts/backportNotFoundDhatuIds.py \
    Scripts/AI_Generated/output \
    Data

# 3. Verify changes
# 4. Continue with next batch
```

## File Breakdown

| File | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `not_found_dhatu_ids_without_gati.yaml` | 576 | Verbs without gati needing dhatu_id |

---

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Only edit the `dhatu_id` field**
- Don't modify `form`, `gati`, `kanda`, `varga`, or other metadata
- The backport script uses this metadata to find the correct location

‚úÖ **Incremental processing**
- Backport script automatically skips unedited entries
- Edit in small batches for better accuracy
- Can run backport multiple times safely

---

## Example Edit

Find the correct dhatu_id from ‡§ß‡§æ‡§§‡•Å‡§™‡§æ‡§† or dictionaries:

```yaml
# Before
"‡§Æ‡•á‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø":
  "dhatu_id": "Not Found"

# After (example - verify with proper reference)
"‡§Æ‡•á‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§§‡§ø":
  "dhatu_id": "01.0XXX"  # Replace with actual correct ID
```

## Notes

‚úÖ The `‡§®‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§•‡§µ‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡§É` folder is automatically excluded
‚úÖ Original YAML structure is preserved
‚úÖ Changes are safely tracked and reported
‚úÖ Can process incrementally (edit a few at a time)
