Any Verb with or without gati cannot have more than one dhatu_id,

You have to collect all such cases which has more than one dhat_id and create an Yaml File.

Also Create an Infra to backPort when that Yaml File is manually changed. ( These modified changes such get reflected back to the original yaml files from where this data is collected.)

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### Scripts Created:

1. **collectMultipleDhatuIds.py** - Collects all verbs with multiple dhatu_ids from the JSON file
   - Location: `Scripts/collectMultipleDhatuIds.py`
   - Input: `Scripts/output/AkhyataChandrika_Autogenerated.json`
   - Output: **TWO separate YAML files** (improved design):
     - `Scripts/output/multiple_dhatu_ids_without_gati.yaml` (159 cases)
     - `Scripts/output/multiple_dhatu_ids_with_gati.yaml` (126 cases)
   - Total found: 330 cases with multiple dhatu_ids

2. **backportMultipleDhatuIds.py** - Backports manual corrections to original YAML files
   - Location: `Scripts/backportMultipleDhatuIds.py`
   - Input: Can process either:
     - Single file: `Scripts/output/multiple_dhatu_ids_without_gati.yaml`
     - All files in directory: `Scripts/output` (recommended)
   - Updates: Original YAML files in `Data/` folder

3. **testBackport.sh** & **workflow_example.sh** - Test and workflow demonstration scripts
   - Location: `Scripts/testBackport.sh`, `Scripts/workflow_example.sh`

### Documentation:
- **README_MultipleDhatuIds.md** - Complete workflow documentation with examples
  - Location: `Scripts/README_MultipleDhatuIds.md`
- **SUMMARY.md** - Technical overview and implementation details
  - Location: `Scripts/SUMMARY.md`

### Key Improvement:
The collection script now creates **two separate files** for easier manual editing:
- Verbs WITHOUT gati (simpler cases) - 159 entries
- Verbs WITH gati (may need more careful review) - 126 entries

This separation makes the manual correction process more organized and easier to manage.

### Usage:
See `Scripts/README_MultipleDhatuIds.md` for detailed workflow instructions.

Note: The scripts automatically skip the `Data/3_नानार्थवर्गः` folder as requested.
