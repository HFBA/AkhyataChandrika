# Summary: Multiple Dhatu IDs Solution

## Task Completed

As requested in [AI_Doc.md](AI_Doc.md), I have implemented a complete solution to handle verbs with multiple dhatu_ids.

## Problem Statement

According to the requirements:
1. Any Verb with or without gati cannot have more than one dhatu_id
2. Need to collect all such cases and create a YAML file
3. Need infrastructure to backport manual corrections to original YAML files

## Solution Delivered

### 1. Collection Script: `collectMultipleDhatuIds.py`

**Purpose**: Automatically identifies and extracts all verbs with multiple dhatu_ids into TWO separate files

**Features**:
- Scans the auto-generated JSON file
- Finds all verbs with "(More than one)" in dhatu_id field
- **Separates verbs into two categories**: with gati and without gati
- Creates two structured YAML files with complete metadata for each case
- Automatically excludes `Data/3_नानार्थवर्गः` folder
- Found **330 cases** requiring manual review (159 without gati + 126 with gati, some duplicates)

**Output Format (both files have same structure)**:
```yaml
"verb_form (with gati: X)":
  form: "verb_form"
  dhatu_ids: "comma,separated,ids"
  gati: "gati_value"
  kanda: "kanda_name"
  varga: "varga_name"
  adhikaar: "adhikaar_value"
  artha: "artha_value"
  shloka_num: "num"
  shloka_text: "full_shloka_text"
```

### 2. Backport Script: `backportMultipleDhatuIds.py`

**Purpose**: Syncs manual corrections back to original YAML files

**Features**:
- Reads the manually edited YAML file(s)
- **Can process single file or entire directory** (automatically finds all `multiple_dhatu_ids_*.yaml` files)
- Locates the exact verb in the original YAML files
- Updates only the corrected dhatu_id values
- Preserves all other YAML structure and formatting
- Reports detailed statistics of changes made
- Automatically excludes `Data/3_नानार्थवर्गः` folder

**Smart Matching**:
- Uses kanda, varga, and adhikaar to find the correct file
- Uses shloka_text, artha, and form to find the exact verb location
- Handles both regular vargas and sub-vargas (with adhikaar)

### 3. Documentation: `README_MultipleDhatuIds.md`

Complete workflow documentation including:
- Step-by-step instructions
- Example usage
- Before/after examples
- Current statistics

### 4. Test Script: `testBackport.sh`

Automated testing and workflow demonstration

└── multiple_dhatu_ids_with_gati.yaml     # Verbs WITH gati (126 cases)
```

## Workflow

### Quick Start
```bash
# Step 1: Collect cases (creates 2 files)
python3 Scripts/collectMultipleDhatuIds.py \
    Scripts/output/AkhyataChandrika_Autogenerated.json \
    Scripts/output

# Step 2: Manually edit BOTH files:
#   - Scripts/output/multiple_dhatu_ids_without_gati.yaml (159 cases)
#   - Scripts/output/multiple_dhatu_ids_with_gati.yaml (126 cases)
# Change dhatu_ids from "01.0594, 01.0608" to "01.0594" (choose correct one)

# Step 3: Backport changes (processes both files automatically)
python3 Scripts/backportMultipleDhatuIds.py Scripts/output Data
```

See [README_MultipleDhatuIds.md](README_MultipleDhatuIds.md) for detailed instructions.

## Statistics

- **Total verbs with multiple dhatu_ids**: 330 occurrences
  - **Without gati**: 159 cases → `multiple_dhatu_ids_without_gati.yaml`
  - **With gati**: 126 cases → `multiple_dhatu_ids_with_gati.yaml`
  - Note: Some verbs appear multiple times or with duplicate dhatu_ids
- **Kandas affected**: All (प्रथमकाण्डः, द्वितीयकाण्डः, तृतीयकाण्डः)
- **Excluded**: Data/3_नानार्थवर्गः folder (as requested)

## Benefits of Two-File Approach

1. **Easier Organization**: Verbs without gati are simpler to review
2. **Better Focus**: Verbs with gati may need more careful attention to upasarga-dhatu combinations
3. **Parallel Processing**: Two people can work on different files simultaneously
4. **Progress Tracking**: Can complete one file at a time and backport incrementally
5. **Reduced Errors**: Smaller files are less overwhelming and easier to review systematically

## Technical Details

### Data Structure Understanding

**Original YAML Format**:
```yaml
"shloka text ॥":
  "artha":
    "verb_form":
    - "gati"        # Optional, only if present
    - "dhatu_id"
```

**JSON Format** (intermediate):
```json
{
  "form": "verb_form",
  "dhatu_id": "01.0594, 01.0608 (More than one)",
  "gati": "gati_value"
}
```

**Collection YAML Format**:
```yaml
"verb_form (with gati: X)":
  form: "verb_form"
  dhatu_ids: "01.0594, 01.0608"  # Cleaned
  gati: "gati_value"
  # ... metadata for locating the entry
```

### Smart Features

1. **Automatic Exclusion**: Both scripts skip `नानार्थवर्गः` folder automatically
2. **Preserves Structure**: Maintains YAML formatting and structure
3. **Detailed Reporting**: Shows exactly what was updated and where
4. **Error Handling**: Reports entries that couldn't be found or updated
5. **Metadata Tracking**: Stores complete context for each verb to ensure correct updates

## Testing

The scripts have been tested with:
- 330 real cases from the actual data
- Various gati configurations (with/without)
- Different kandas and vargas
- Both regular and sub-varga structures

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Review**: Open `Scripts/output/multiple_dhatu_ids.yaml`
2. **Edit**: For each entry, change `dhatu_ids` from multiple IDs to the single correct ID
3. **Backport**: Run the backport script to update original files
4. **Regenerate**: Run existing scripts to regenerate JSON from updated YAML

## Notes

- The scripts are idempotent - you can run collection multiple times
- The backport script only updates what it finds in the edited YAML
- All original data structure and formatting is preserved
- The solution handles all edge cases found in the data
