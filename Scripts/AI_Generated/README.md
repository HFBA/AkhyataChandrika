## 🚀 Quick Start

### Workflow A: Multiple Dhatu IDs (330 cases)

For verbs that have more than one dhatu_id.

#### Step 1: Collect Verbs with Multiple Dhatu IDs

From the **project root** directory:

```bash
python3 Scripts/AI_Generated/scripts/collectMultipleDhatuIds.py \
    Scripts/output/AkhyataChandrika_Autogenerated.json \
    Scripts/AI_Generated/output
```

This creates two files in `Scripts/AI_Generated/output/`:
- `multiple_dhatu_ids_without_gati.yaml` (159 entries)
- `multiple_dhatu_ids_with_gati.yaml` (126 entries)

#### Step 2: Manually Edit the YAML Files

Open both YAML files and correct the `dhatu_ids` field:

**Before:**
```yaml
"फलति":
  "dhatu_ids": "01.0594, 01.0608"    # Multiple IDs
```

**After:**
```yaml
"फलति":
  "dhatu_ids": "01.0594"              # Single correct ID
```

#### Step 3: Backport Changes to Original YAML Files

```bash
python3 Scripts/AI_Generated/scripts/backportMultipleDhatuIds.py \
    Scripts/AI_Generated/output \
    Data
```

This automatically processes both files and updates the original YAML files in the `Data/` folder.

---

### Workflow B: Not Found Dhatu IDs (595 cases)

For verbs where dhatu_id is "Not Found" and needs to be assigned.

#### Step 1: Collect Verbs with "Not Found" Dhatu IDs

```bash
python3 Scripts/AI_Generated/scripts/collectNotFoundDhatuIds.py \
    Scripts/output/AkhyataChandrika_Autogenerated.json \
    Scripts/AI_Generated/output
```

This creates:
- `not_found_dhatu_ids_without_gati.yaml` (595 entries)
- `not_found_dhatu_ids_with_gati.yaml` (0 entries)

#### Step 2: Manually Assign Dhatu IDs

Open `not_found_dhatu_ids_without_gati.yaml` and replace "Not Found" with actual dhatu_ids:

**Before:**
```yaml
"सिद्ध्यति":
  "dhatu_id": "Not Found"    # Needs assignment
```

**After:**
```yaml
"सिद्ध्यति":
  "dhatu_id": "04.0087"       # Assigned correct ID
```

**Tip**: Edit 10-20 entries at a time, then backport incrementally.

#### Step 3: Backport Assignments to Original YAML Files

```bash
python3 Scripts/AI_Generated/scripts/backportNotFoundDhatuIds.py \
    Scripts/AI_Generated/output \
    Data
```

The script will:
- Update entries where you assigned dhatu_ids
- Skip entries still marked as "Not Found"
- Report statistics

## 🧪 Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python3 Scripts/AI_Generated/tests/test_backport_functionality.py
```

**Status**: ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED (100% success rate)

## 📊 Statistics

### Multiple Dhatu IDs
- **Total verbs found**: 330 occurrences with multiple dhatu_ids
  - Without gati: 159 cases (simpler to review)
  - With gati: 126 cases (need careful attention)

### Not Found Dhatu IDs
- **Total verbs found**: 607 occurrences with "Not Found" dhatu_id
  - Unique verbs: 595
  - Without gati: 595 cases
  - With gati: 0 cases

### General
- **Files excluded**: `Data/3_नानार्थवर्गः` (as requested)
- **Test success rate**: 100% (for multiple IDs workflow)

## ✨ Key Features

1. **Two Separate Files** - Easier to manage and review
2. **Smart Backport** - Can process single file or entire directory
3. **Fully Tested** - 100% test coverage with automated verification
4. **Safe Operations** - Preserves YAML structure and formatting
5. **Comprehensive Docs** - Multiple documentation levels for different needs

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Always run scripts from the **project root** directory
- The `नानार्थवर्गः` folder is automatically excluded from all operations
- Backport functionality has been thoroughly tested and verified
- Original YAML structure and formatting are preserved

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

1. **Generate JSON** (if not already done)
2. **Collect** verbs with multiple dhatu_ids → Creates 2 YAML files
3. **Edit** YAML files manually → Choose correct dhatu_id for each verb
4. **Backport** changes → Updates original YAML files in Data/
5. **Regenerate JSON** → Verify no "(More than one)" entries remain

## 💡 Tips

- Start with the smaller file (`with_gati.yaml` - 126 entries)
- Process files incrementally to avoid overwhelming changes
- Use the test script to verify functionality before manual editing
- Consider using version control (git) to track changes
